# Linux Journey – Getting Started

## 1. Linux History
Linux began with UNIX, developed in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.  
Later, Richard Stallman started the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project and introduced the GPL (General Public License), enabling free software development.  
In 1991, Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel, combining with GNU components to form modern Linux operating systems. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}


## 2. The Shell
- The shell is a program that reads your commands and sends them to the operating system.
- Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is the most common shell in Linux.  
- Your prompt typically looks like:

username@hostname:current_directory$

The `$` indicates a normal user. You don’t type the prompt itself.  
- A simple example:
```bash
echo Hello World

This prints “Hello World” to the terminal.

3. Choosing a Linux Distribution

Different distributions ("distros") cater to varied users:

Debian
A stable and widely used distro with free open-source components. It offers branches like Stable, Testing, and Unstable. 

Ubuntu (not detailed here, but based on Debian commonly used by beginners)

Fedora
Community-driven and upstream for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Uses RPM package manager. 

Linux Mint
Based on Ubuntu but lighter and generally more beginner-friendly. 

Gentoo
Highly configurable, source-based distro using Portage. Suited for advanced users. 

Arch Linux
Lightweight, rolling-release, and highly customizable, ideal for experienced users. Uses Pacman as package manager.
