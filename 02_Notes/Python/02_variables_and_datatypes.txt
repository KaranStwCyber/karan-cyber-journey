ğŸ‘‰ A variable is the name given to a memory location in a program.
-> for example: 
-> a = 30
-> b = "Karan"

-> variables = container to store a value.
-> keywords = reserved words in python.

ğŸ‘‰ Data Types
-> Primarily there are following data types in python:
(i) Integers
(ii) Strings
(iii) Float
(iv) boolean
(v) None

-> python is an excellent language that automatically identifies the type of data for us.
a = 71 -> identifies as integer
b = "Karan" -> identifies as string.

ğŸ‘‰ Rules for defining a variable name:-

-> Also applies to other identifiers.
-> A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores.
-> A variable name can't start with a number.
-> No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
-> Example:- Karan, seven, a, xenon, _karan, etc.

ğŸ‘‰ Operators in Python

-> Following are some common operators in python.

(i) Arithmetic operators -: +, -, *, /,etc
(ii) Assignment operators-: =, +=, -=, etc.
(iii) Comparsion operators-: ==, >,>=,<,<=,!=,etc.
(iv) Logical opeators-: and, or , not.

ğŸ‘‰ Type () function and Typecasting:-

-> Type function is used to find the data type of a given variable in python.

a = 30
type(a) -> class <int>

b = "96"
type(b) -> class <str>

c = 90
type(c -> class <int>

-> A number can be converted into a string and vice versa( if possible). There are many functions to convert one data  type to another.

str(32) = "32" integer to string
float(32) = 32.0 integer to float
int("32") = 32 string to integer

ğŸ‘‰ Input functions

-> This function allows us to take the input from user as a string, we can convert its type as we want the input.

a = input("Enter your name: ")

-> It is important to note that the output of input is always a string (even if the number is entered).

-> If a is "Karan" and b is "Satyawali" if we do a + b we will get "Karan Satyawali".

ğŸ‘‰ Thats's it for variables and data types make sure to understand it as it is used in all over python later.
