#14.1 virtual environment

# pip install virtualenv - it will create a virtual environment which will be isloated from our global environment we can run it by typing virtualenv name

# We create a new environment using: 
# virtualenv myprojectenv # Creates a new venv 
# The next step after creating the virtual environment is to activate it. 
# We can now use this virtual environment as a separate Python installation

#14.2 - PIP FREEZE COMMAND - returns all the package installed in a given python environment along with the versions.

# pip freeze > requirements .txt

#14.3 LAMBDA FUNCTIONS

def square(n):
    return n*n

print(square(56))

square = lambda x: x*x
print(square(5))

sum = lambda a,b,c: a+b+c
print(sum(4,7,9))

from functools import reduce

#14.4 JOIN METHOD - (STRINGS)

a = ["Karan", "Rohan", "Satyawali"]
final = "-".join(a)
print(final)

#14.5 format method - (strings)

a = "{} is a good {}".format("Karan", "Boy")
print(a)

#14.6 Map, Filter and Reduce Method

# (i) MAP
l = [1,2,3,4,5]
square = lambda x: x*x
sqlist = map(square, l)
print(list(sqlist))

# (ii) Filter

def even(n):
    if(n%2 == 0):
        return True
    return False
onlyeven = filter(even, l)
print(list(onlyeven))

# (iii) Reduce Function

def sum(a,b):
    return a+b

mul = lambda x,y: x*y
print(reduce(sum, l)) # it will sum the items in list l with the pairing of 2 numbers like 1+2=3 , 3+3=6, 6+4=10, 10+5=15
print(reduce(mul, l))
